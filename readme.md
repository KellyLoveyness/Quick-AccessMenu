How to create new commands:

1. Create a namehere.js file in the QuickAccessMenuCommands folder, preferably with the same name as the command.
2. See demo.js for the structure of the namehere.js file. Edit with any text editor. Various help resources exists in QuickAccessMenuGlobal.js.
2. In the contentscript.js file, add the name of the created namehere.js file to to QuickAccessMenuScripts array.
4. If the command script needs a global variable, create it in the QuickAccessMenuGlobal.js file.
5. Settings that concern the entirety of QuickAccessMenu, such as which chat prefix symbol to use, should be placed in QuickAccessMenuSettings.js.
6. All done! Remember, changes can be added officially. Reach out either on https://discord.gg/YukepB6RVp or add directly at https://github.com/KellyLoveyness/Quick-AccessMenu/

Installation Tutorial:

Either, the files can be grabbed directly from the link below, which in case of FireFox is the only option for a signed .xpi (one-time installation).
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YpScmA5d1_PlECKP_tcOyZRgeBiKK4yD


1. Download the newest version, by either link above or from here by clicking green "Code" button, and install as a .zip.
2. Depending on browser, the file might have to be right-clicked and extracted to a folder.
3. In browser, navigate to Extension menu. Typically, posting this in link address bar works: chrome://extensions/
4. Enable developer mode with the switch in the top right corner.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner
6. Find and select the file.
7. If the file won't load, redo step 2 differently.
8. The add-on is now installed. Refresh the club and enjoy.
