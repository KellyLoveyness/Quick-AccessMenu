How to create new commands:
1. Create a namehere.js file in the QuickAccessMenuCommands folder, preferably with the same name as the command.
2. See demo.js for the structure of the namehere.js file. Edit with any text editor. Various help resources exists in QuickAccessMenuGlobal.js.
2. In the contentscript.js file, add the name of the created namehere.js file to to QuickAccessMenuScripts array.
4. If the command script needs a global variable, create it in the QuickAccessMenuGlobal.js file.
5. Settings that concern the entirety of QuickAccessMenu, such as which chat prefix symbol to use, should be placed in QuickAccessMenuSettings.js.
6. All done! Remember, changes can be added officially. Reach out either on https://discord.gg/YukepB6RVp or XXXXX
